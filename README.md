# VLO mappings and vocabularies
Mapping [definitions](mapping) and [normalisation vocabularies](uniform-maps) for the [Virtual Language Observatory](https://github.com/clarin-eric/VLO).

## Context/workflow
The following diagram illustrates the intended workflow: the production and beta instance of the VLO source their mapping definitions from a clone of the main repository. The curation team works on a fork and makes pull requests once new mappings have been established. Mapping adaptions can be the result of processing secondary source files (e.g. tabular representations) or services (such as CLAVAS), potentially authored by external curators and domain experts.
